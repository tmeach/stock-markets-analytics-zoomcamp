    "Find the optimal number of days X (between 1 and 30), where 75% quantile growth is the highest?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reuse [Code Snippet 1] to retrieve the list of IPOs from 2023 and 2024 (from URLs: https://stockanalysis.com/ipos/2023/ and https://stockanalysis.com/ipos/2024/). Get all OHLCV daily prices for all stocks with an \"IPO date\" before March 1, 2024 (\"< 2024-03-01\") - 184 tickers (without 'RYZB'). Please remove 'RYZB', as it is no longer available on Yahoo Finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you may need to adjust the symbol name (e.g., 'IBAC' on stockanalysis.com -> 'IBACU' on Yahoo Finance) to locate OHLCV prices for all stocks. Also, you can see the ticker changes using this link. Some of the tickers (like 'DYCQ' and 'LEGT') were on the market less than 30 days (11 and 21 days, respectively). Let's leave them in the dataset; it just means that you couldn't hold them for more days than they were listed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume you managed to buy a new stock (listed on IPO) on the first day at the [Adj Close] price]. Your strategy is to hold for exactly X full days (where X is between 1 and 30) and sell at the \"Adj. Close\" price in X days (e.g., if X=1, you sell on the next day). Find X, when the 75% quantile growth (among 185 investments) is the highest.\n",
